# Geofencing-Technology-for-Forgotten-Objects

Status: In Progress

This project will look to analyze a very real-world problem. 
People tend to leave things they need for work or other activities,
at home. Items such as phones, wallets, glasses or planners, 
are often forgotten. This project will seek to solve this issue to prevent 
a long, disgruntled and frustrating drive back home to collect the forgotten 
article. Through modern Geofencing and Bluetooth technology we will create a 
“reminder” system that could be set up to stop a person from ever leaving the 
house without their needed items again. A functional mobile app serves as the 
liaison between user and object. Each piece of technology is tied together and
has the ability to be both alerted and trigger the alert that the person is 
missing something in their network of necessary possessions. A Geofence is 
set up around the user’s home and in the event one of those objects is not
present upon exiting the area, this will trip the Geofence and warn the user 
that they are missing an item and it would cause one of the other items to 
receive an alert. The majority of people who forget things tend to only forget 
one item and remember everything else. Therefore, in this event through an app 
on their smart device (provided that isn’t the one device they forget) the 
Geofence would be triggered and the forgotten device would send a notification 
to the smart device and alert the user. In the event the user forgets their phone, 
the technology would be able to beep or generate a noise that alerts the user of the forgotten device.
